then point to a new SubgraphDeployment, thus allowing the Subgraph to resolve to a different
deployment, while keeping the same endpoint. The metadata and label are stored on IPFS. The label
is for the developer to provide a semantic version. This is different from the version, which is
just a counter than increases each time a new SubgraphVersion is created for a Subgraph.
